Mercato: a Sainsbury's Scraper in Go
=====

## Logic
Mercato is a console application that will scrape a grocery store's web page and grab every product's url children page for additional information.

This task could be completed with PHP, Java or Go. However, I have chosen Go because of the possibility to run every scrape request as a concurrent goroutine, thus augmenting the response time.

### Notes
When I am required to

>follow each link and get the size (in kb) of the linked HTML (no assets)
and the description to display in the JSON

I see on the product's page that there is just a short text in the description that does not correspond to the example. If I check the source code though, the ".productText" html class corresponds to many items under the "Information" Tab.

For example: http://hiring-tests.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/2015_Developer_Scrape/sainsburys-avocado--ripe---ready-x2.html
Description: "Avocados" (aka: first instance of `".productText"`)

I have chosen to grab only that description: if it's required to grab the whole "Info" page I can quickly modify the code.

## Dependencies
